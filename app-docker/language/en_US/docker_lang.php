This means they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and everything in between - and they don\'t require you to use a particular language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without depending on a particular stack or provider.';
